you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play a  just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder in any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re stacks is what the speakers played i'd be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe we used each other's air just for the people to see and stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep we'd go anywhere our minds would take us and i said you are beautiful without your makeup and you don't even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us and time's the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now  and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone  watching blue planet creating new habits then as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just reevaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in a day we'll have to say it again  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina uh won't you leave me now now  love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now  oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both in a road won't you leave me now now,pop

rap profit made a livin' and a killin' off it ever since bill clinton was still in office with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack i'm an mc still as honest but as rude and as indecent as all hell

crap yapyap yacketyyack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce   'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like ι have got   well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mcs get taken to school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz pac nwa

omnipotent let off then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,rap

driving around your side of this town like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now finally i found your new address park in your drive feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house see it's sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it's revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potentiali peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk and here's your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it we're in a car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey here's a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy how's this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this you'll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two

this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again  part  produced by streetrunner  4 i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off,rap

47,pt i   hands up officer dont shoot then pull your pants up promise you won't loot we may never understand each other its no use we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through   black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots

someone's tryna summon someone i know something's comin' but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin' get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin' i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are countin' me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin' i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause you're moving onto the next but is your respect gone cause someone told me that   gwen stefani kings never die   eminem don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldn't even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged why am i online it's driving me crazy i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge on what's hot but i'm not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage they so want a champion to fall it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again cause all the

hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end that's why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawin' more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i'd just zone out good luck tryin' to convince a blonde it's like tellin' gwen

pulled apart from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not what i'm doin' i just blow my head is a stove top i just explode the kettle gets so hot sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that i don't got but i've learned it's time for me to uturn yo it only takes one time for me

171,and everyone should get along okay children quiet down quiet down children i'd like to duce our new substitute teacher for the day his name is mr shady children quiet down please brian don't throw that shut up mr shady will be your new substitute while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia he's got aids good luck mr shady   hi there little boys and girls fuck you today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's thirty and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you   see children drugs are bad come on and if you don't believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you don't believe him ask your mom that's right she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs that's right so you don't act like everyone else does uhhuh and there's really nothin' else to say sing along drugs are just bad mmkay   my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels ecstasyit's the worst drug in the world if someone ever offers it to you don't do it kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back so don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you   see children drugs are bad that's right and if you don't believe me ask your dad that's right and if you don't believe him ask your mom you can she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs don't smoke crack so you don't act like everyone else does that's right and there's really nothin' else to say but umm drugs are just bad mmkay   and last but not least one of the most humongous problems among young people today is fungus it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em and sometimes you see things that aren't there like what like fat women in gstrings with orange hair mr shady what's a gstring it's yarn claire women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em huh and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms whoops did i say 'magic mushrooms' i meant fungus your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue how come 'cause it comes from a cow's

sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad disgruntled had some struggles yeah but that passion and hunger's back what a fantastic juggling act and the way i flip my tongue on the track it's like verbal acrobatics but in fact last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic i fuckin' crashed my hovercraft after i strapped a duffel bag to my back and stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it and an elastic bungee strap rubber plaster a thumb tack and a piece of plastic bubble wrap went spastic and fuckin' snapped jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid stumbled back recovered back flipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat and for my last trick lunge on back latch on a nasa shuttle flap fuckin' snap the rudder in half chuckled and laughed utter my last rebuttal and just as i'm to come crashin' i grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat rub my magic mushroom tat for luck then splat get up from that face taped to a waste

191,eminem  royce da 5'9 i've always looked at battle rap as competition or war and the main objective is to destroy completely fuckin obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything whatever the fuck you can to get a reaction from the crowd so nothing's off limits i need you to spit that lyrical miracle in the swimming pool   before this kicks off let me set my balls on this tees 'cause im dottin' i's every time i cross one of these there's not a redeeming quality at all in me it's impossible seems like an implausible dream positive clean thoughts intervene but they're all either altered and mean assault and demean tossed and they're being lost in the scheme squashed in between a brainwashing machine like an islamic regime a jihadist extreme radical suicide bomber that's seeing ariana grande sing her last song of the evening and as the audience from the damn concert is leaving detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region im not gonna finish that for obvious reasons but bring your dogs ima muzzle 'em im not middle eastern but i'll make a bitch rock a hijab and at least a extra large in a tshirt headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet hasta la vista i go hamas on the beats a paradox on the beach and a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich professional shit sprayer bitch watch who you talkin' to like apple wristwear endangered species in this abc shit a bit scarce preys decreasing i face extinction like disc players told this chick she's hot as jada pinkett and just stared 'til i made her think it said maybe we should just get married she's facing me i placed my feet with my hips square tell her turn around spread her legs for me then i hit bare leave her stretched out like a baby tshirt on ric flair as i rip tear anal beads in a split rear spray febreze in the chick's hair make her wheeze tryna get air i played for keeps there's no escaping me i have a bitch scared and chained to me and throw away the key and she'll be so afraid to leave that even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up it's impossible like rapin' a slut we stay buttnaked and fuck you're close wait for you what my idea you comin' too is waking you up with smelling salts after i quaalude your cup that'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup hate to get bogged down in details but bitch i'm like the dog pound with females my brain is corrupt real life hillside strangler i strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular shaped but it's upside down and my mouth ain't gonna shut and mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck or helps you rake in the ducats i want payment in pub 'cause i ain't tryna get in your bars like i'm waiting the club but if you put me in your lines i'm takin' a cut   get a million writers inside of a room combined in it try to get every idea of every possible line to spit every punchline every combination that rhymes with it bitch a whole team can't see me there's no i's in it head so big i shot myself ten times in it tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes and i survived this shit someone's gonna challenge me who battle me and win that's a fucking fallacy too you name one motherfucker in this galaxy spits reality you fantasy rally your

reach a far cry from it or it's in my grasp but as soon as i grab squeeze i lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze into the dark i plummet now the sky's blackening i know the mark's high butter flies

search of the that i haven't spit yet will this step just be another misstep to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect i've garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless and it always feels like i'm hittin' the mark 'til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart like this shit is garbage god's given me all this still i feel no different regardless kids look to me as a god this is retarded if only they knew it's a facade and it's exhaustive and i try not to listen to nonsense but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence mission accomplished i'm not godsent nas rakim 'pac big james todd smith and i'm not prince so   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like

looking down on me that matters now's deshaun am i lucky to be around this long begs the question though especially after the methadone as yesterday fades and the dresden home is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn the crowds are gone and it's time to wash out the blonde sales decline the curtain's drawn they're closin' the set i'm still pokin' my head from out behind and everyone who has doubt remind now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes and as i grow outta sight outta mind i might go outta mine 'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine but when i do fall from these heights though i'll be fine i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause   skylar grey i walk on water but i ain't no jesus i walk on water but only when it freezes  post skylar grey 'cause i'm only human just like you i've been making my mistakes oh if you only knew i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh if i walked

402,music  i had met paul em's manager a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road we just worked out it was meant to be at this time i think it's unlike any current hip hop songs if you listen to what's going on in hip hop this is not what this is em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days and it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop  we were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up it started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record the song sort of evolves it started one way it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song  and i felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction em was gonna go in vocally and then when i heard the vocals that was pretty exciting because it was not at all what i was expecting and just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it it's so well done and so smart and so funny it's just great in this song we ended up using a wired  and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed  it reminds me of old hip hop videos and i think it's really entertaining and i look forward to see it all put together and done but in the shooting stages the pieces i've seen look really entertaining,rap

know that i gotta clear my throat and excite i'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so i can bust some material i take it around my leg and then all the mc's wanna beg and say yo please give me a turn i say no because it's my turn to burn and i bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that i do 'cause you're dissed you're dissed so bad every time sure he don't get a turn and he's starting to get mad but i'm just going to take the mic i'm not gonna give it to him because i am so damn hyped in the place to be rhyming like this 'cause i'm an mc rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat it's kinda gay like liberace but hey listen to the words that i display every time i kick a rhyme this way you know that the star is worthwhile every time i grab the mic i'm longer than

so don't even try it i don't buy it so you'd better keep quiet 'cause you're into it ain't nothing but to do it  4 you'd better catch up 'cause you're trailing you'd better put springs in your ass and jump like van halen every time i bust a rhyme i get like a panther if you're lying that slander 'cause you're lying like berry saunders every time i grab the mic i get married and i like to kick a rhyme that i pick every time i pick the mic up i stick a dick right up your ass like a faggot you're gonna die be crawling with maggots every time i dread you like hair i said you'd better get  on your underwear you'd better run 'cause if you don't afraid you'll be seeing a ghost like a rake you ain't an eighth of me every time i grab the mic girls try to act so faithfully but i say no don't be a fan just try to step to my dick and act like a man no that don't make no sense but every time  i cut class like a pair of scissors i get so damn hyped on the mic 'cause every time i step to the

481,are you feeling good about the album at this point um that's a tough question man for the most part yeah but i don't know if i ever feel totally great about a record when i put it out with every record that i put out someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when i listen to my own music i just hear flaws in it like i hear 'oh fuck i could have done this better or that better' and i'll work it to death obviously if i wasn't comfortable with it i wouldn't put it out but from the beginning ever since my career started i don't know if i've ever been totally like this is completely it  in this last crunch what have you been working on i guess you would say last minute jitters of fuck are the vocals loud enough can you hear what i'm saying on this part is the beat right are the vocals too loud' if i could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that i rapped over and put them out i would do that 'cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it  but you're not changing lyrics or anything like that it's just all mix and sound stuff it's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part because when i decide to keep a song that's pretty much it like if it doesn't work i pretty much know right away right when i get it in the car and take it home  rolling stone's review of eminem's the marshall mathers lp   so why did you dye your hair blonde again um i'll say that one was manager paul rosenberg's idea in the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit i had thought about it and once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be he hit me with the idea and i was like yo you know i thought about that right and he was like well you know why not and i was like i don't know how it's gonna look i haven't had it in how many fucking years five six years i was like i'm so used to it being dark you know so i just tried it and i was like fuck it  did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording not really honestly because i already had most of the songs and i don't know if i'm gonna keep it like this or how long i'm gonna keep it but for right now it is what it is and i feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record  for recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff you recorded 00 songs or something or at least you had 00 beats so was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around i feel like right now i'm probably working harder than i've ever worked in my life and i've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during the eminem show which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time just being so busy with the eminem show and doing the 8 mile movie and the soundtrack and the score to the movie this is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly  that's crazy once i had the direction that i wanted to go and you know calling it the marshall mathers lp  obviously i knew that there might be certain expectations like i wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that so i wanted to make sure that i had the right songs to be able to call it that so a lot of recording a lot of songs that people probably will never hear we hit a couple of road blocks there were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever and just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like fuck man i feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture  a lot of people maybe even you think the original is your best album it's probably my favorite i think some of them are my favorites for different reasons hate to even say that about my own record but i mean the first three records i think they may have captured a time period and then i think i pretty much probably have publicly said you know encore and relapse wasn't  it was just a different time  you've been hard on relapse but tyler the creator says that it's his favorite hiphop record in years he loves that record yeah he tells me that every time i see him i don't hate the record i want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs and you know i don't know if i necessarily found that balance yet because i was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like ha ha this is funny you know walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it because when i got sober it was like  i've said this before  but it just was like oh shit i can think straight again so i don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs writing songs that felt like something that brought some kind of emotion i ran accents into the ground i got stuck on that kind of serial killer crazy vibe and just kind of went with it  on recovery obviously the world came to you on that one how do you feel now about that record i feel like that record i finally got back to where i was at maybe during the eminem show like creatively and songwriting i guess i mean obviously recovery was the first time i had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp aside from working with dre it was like i always wanted to produce my own records because producing is fun to me too one of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had es on them it's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words because my own hooks i already know what i mean when i write them the way that i do music is like regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have i always want to try to go as hard lyrically as i can so regardless if the beat feels like wow maybe this could be played on the radio i'm not like maybe radio would play this so i'll just wing it like i always have looked at it like i want to approach every record from an mcs' aspect  so how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to the marshall mathers lp how did you decide to make your life miserable like that well here's what it is it's not necessarily a sequel  okay as much as it is a revisitation  like this is a different time period in my life so there's not gonna be like continuations of every song or anything like that to me it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia one of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that you know retro shit and try to make it current like bring it up to date  so did seeking out rick rubin come from that direction you were like why don't i go back to the source paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and i was like fuck man another thing with this record is that i kind of got back into producing more on recovery i wanted to focus more on writing and not have to worry abut making the beats on relapse i think it was mostly all dre so i kind of started producing again a little bit i was kind of in the middle of that when paul had mentioned that and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and i don't know if that's what made paul reach out to rick or if rick reached out to him but as soon as i heard he was interested i was like yo just let me finish this up and let's go see him  you've called rick yoda  was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career yoda voice learning i did um yeah i mean the best part about rick's vibe is he's very zenlike in the sense of just let it happen the weird thing about it is nine times out 0 we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right you know he's almost like a coach  he's very psychological right yeah the guy's got his shoes off laughs working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere he's not afraid to try anything i kind of felt in the same way i felt and still feel to this day as far as like wanting to impress dre we talked at his house and then i think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats i told him that i had started experimenting with some more retro sounds so we just sat down and started picking shit out and i would start writing to them and next time i'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it the dude's got so many ideas man one of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the rick rubin scratches when he fucking scratches some shit it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it not that it's offtime or anything like that but it's just like  it's fucking weird i don't even know how to explain it you just know that he scratched it i don't know if that even makes sense or not it's like a simple scratch like a basic kind of thing but it's so fucking dope when you hear it it's just it's vintage him and plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit  did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio oh he's got some shit in the stash yeah definitely  so much has changed in hiphop since you started producing  did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff um not necessarily because like i feel like i just do whatever feels right obviously i pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse but i don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing that's no offense to anyone else  basically if there are outside influences that are current you let that come in from the other producers but your shit is your shit yeah that's exactly it more currentsounding shit i leave to them and not that i don't feel like my shit sounds current but it's not the exact same thing and i think i've updated as well  on the new song legacy you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid what does it take to get back in that mindset at your age i always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said he ain't shit or bullied or whatever it felt like one of them selfempowerment songs everybody i believe wants to show the world that one day i'm gonna be this one day i'm gonna be that everybody has goals aspirations or whatever and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them like if you haven't been kicked or whatever if you never went through    tribulations tribulations and shit like that then you're perfect and fuck you anyways so everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted like you don't matter oh yeah i'm gonna show you so it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy  into what i leave behind when i'm gone and i always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me there's many many songs that got me through a lot of shit  i just love that you rhyme onyx with comics on that song i don't know if anyone will get this like this is supernerdy but the rhyming words in that song never change and that's just one of the things that i do to try to challenge myself i wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed  you've praised the beastie boys' evolution but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment i mean listen my sense of humor has certainly not gone away i realize that i'm an adult a grownass man and i don't know what i'll be doing a year from now 0 years from now but i don't think that my tongueincheekness will ever go away i guess it's just a part of my personality i always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well if one song is darker or talking about a sad subject i don't want to make a whole album of that of being a downer i don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity you gotta try and find that right balance and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting in other words recording till i get it and if i record 00 fucking songs and i don't have what i feel like i need yet to make the body of work then i'm gonna keep going and keep recording  you've written a bunch of your own hooks and even sing some of them where does your sense of melody come from that's a good question i would want to say that it's stemming from early hiphop rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies at least on the shit that i grew up on i don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is i can only hum something but i think it just comes from all the data that i've collected in my years of listening to music and you know fuck man i think that as hiphop started evolving there was more melody in it people were starting to sing hooks even like early slick rick  sings hey young world  those kind of things maybe i took it somewhere different at times i don't know  maybe it's just pure instinct honestly that's probably what it is i don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but i just don't know where i get that sense from you know what i'm saying i'm not a singer singer i just know what's in key and what's not  having kendrick lamar on your album did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you i completely respect what kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp that he's on aftermath only made sense to me he came to detroit we kicked it for a few minutes you know and i felt the vibe of what he's like and everything and you know he's a super cool and super humble dude when we did that record i think that was actually a week or two before he did the to control  is there advice you would give him at this point i don't know if he needs advice he seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders man he's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one he's like a hiphop head man he just loves hiphop and obviously the way that he did the control verse it was almost like if you get mad at him then you might look

for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but

ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake

érdeklem őket doody az életem nagyrészében csak te voltál ott nekem most pedig egyfolytában a képeidet nézegetem sosem volt alkalmam hogy elmondjam neked hogy mennyire is de nagyon szeretlek de most viszont mondogatom ja most amikor te már nem hallhatod viszont mi a fasz jó abban hogy most csinálom ezt valahogyan érzem a jelenléted hogy itt vagy közel mellettem oh amúgy húsvétkor elmentem és vittem néhány ajándékot a srácaidnak annak két gyönyörű fiúnak hogy legalább egy kicsit könnyítsek a gondolataikon és tesó nem fogod elhinni de sharonda szóba áll velemjézusom mindenki próbálja a darabjaiból összekaparni magát ember még is hogy köthettél össze ennyi kibaszott sok életet és aztán csak így itt hagytál minket azt mondják hogy a veszteség mindenkit máshogyan érint ha ez igaz akkor hogy a faszba tehetném túl magamat rajtad ez valóban olyan nehéz amilyennek hangzik  refrén obie trice doody egy könnycseppem foglalom rímekbe erre majd akkor fogsz rábukkanni amikor eljön az a nap

eminem doody így hívtuk mi egymást nem tudom már honnan jött ez de valahogy ránk ragadott mindig is tesók voltunk sosem érdekelt minket egymás bőrszíne míg nem egy nap csak sétáltunk egy nyári napon lent a téren lehetett vagy 90 fok én meg le is égtem próbáltam a fák alá húzódni hogy egy kis kényelembe helyezzem magamat csak nyafogok hogy végre érjek már haza aztán utánad nézek erre azt látom hogy te leveszed a pólódat én meg erre megfogsz sülni te meg nem dehogy hisz én fekete vagyok hülye és a feketék bőrébe melatonin vanmi nem égünk le közben az arcom izzad és úgy érzem hogy felgyulladok és te meg egész idő alatt röhögsz rajtam és meg csapkodsz a pólóddal te szemét és ezt még mindig vissza akarom adni neked és amúgy meg azokat a playboyos gyűrűket amiket anyám megfújt tőled végre nate megtalálta és vissza adta basszus kb 6 éve lehetett nos beteszem őket az ékszereid közé túlteszem magamat rajta de igazából még most sem fogtam fel mindezt de arra mérget vehetsz hogy a hagyatékod sosem fog feledésbe merülni a motor city motown hip hop veterán a hip hop shopban való izgalmak mindez nem áll itt le ja ez valóban olyan nehéz amilyennek hangzik  refrén obie trice doody

légy férfi nincs érzelmeskedés ez a kötelességed amíg nem találkozunk újra doody   eminem és ez lehet hogy egy kicsit furán hangzik de elmondom hogy megtaláltam az a dzsekit amit az esküvőmön hagytál aztán felvettem és  csak megszagoltam összehajtottam és egy üvegvitrinbe tettem aztán levittem a folyosóra hogy bármikor rátudjak nézni és mi mindannyian én meg a d úgy érzünk hogy basszameg a rap ez olyan számunkra mintha a tábornokunk a kibaszott karjaink közt halt volna meg kikapcsoltuk az össze személyhívónkat a postafiókjaink száma is mind megváltozott a másik énjeinket a szemétbe dobtuk tehát néhány macskának új utat kell majd találniuk és tudom hogy ez olyan mintha az álmok veled együtt meghalnának ma de az az igazság az hogy azok még mindig jelen vannak de te már nem vagy itt purple gang annyira beakartad őket futtatni ne adjátok fel az álmaitokat tesó én szeretlek titeket mindannyiótokat és doody az az igazság hogy összehoztad az embereket olyanokat akik amúgy sosem jöttek volna össze egy szobában ha nem miattad lett volna te voltál a béketeremtő doody tudom hogy néha rosszkedvű voltál de utáltad a konfrontációkat és igazából utáltad a vitákat de kiálltál a sajátjaidért még ha balhéra is került sor ha valaminek megkellett történnie akkor annak meg kellett higgyél nekem tudom hogy te vagy az aki megtanított arra hogy hogy vágjak vissza még dresdenben amikor a kocsikat festékpatronokkal lövöldöztük letartoztattak minket és egymással szembe ültünk a cellában  és csak röhögtünk azon hogy ezért 5 évre akartak minket rács mögé dugni de asszem azok a ribancok meg faszok akikre rálőttünk még csak meg se jelentek a bíróságon szóval technikailag szabadon elsétálhattunk én te meg ki is volt ő elfelejtettem a kibaszott nevét szégyen hogy még a

95,here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation,pop

154,so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it,pop

191,when i found old diaries from my childhood and my teens they were covered in dust i'm not just saying that for poetic effect they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes i used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments i'd practice my autograph and tape my  picks to the pages in the entries i daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous i was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game i frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love friends confidence and trust i vented described memories in detail jotted down new song ideas and questioned why i would ever try to shoot for a career i had such a small chance of ever attaining  but what shocked me the most was how often i wrote down the things i loved writing a new song riding in the car with my mom the purplepink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting the dazzle of opal necklaces i couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case i wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such wonderment intrigue romance i noticed things and decided they were romantic and so they were  in life we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be how to act or how to be happy like invisible smoke in the room we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life we constantly question our choices our surroundings and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes all the while we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love  i've decided that in this life i want to be defined by the things i love not the things i hate the things i'm afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but they're not my identity i wish the same for you may your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you turn those voices up in the mix in your head may you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didn't i hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed i hope that if there is a lover in your life it's someone who deserves you if that's the case i hope you treat them with care  this album is a love letter to love itself all the captivating spellbinding maddening devastating red blue gray golden aspects of it that's why there are so many songs in honor of fever dreams bad boys confessions of love on a drunken night out christmas lights still hanging in january  string scars on my hands false gods and blind faith memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light finally finding a friend and opening the curtains to see the clearest brightest daylight after the darkest night  we are what we love this is lover,pop

225,according to my birth certificate i turn 0 this year it's weird because part of me still feels 8 and part of me feels 8 but the actual age i currently am is 9 i've heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so i'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i'd share some lessons i've learned before reaching 0 because it's 09 and sharing is caring  lesson   i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent how youre failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way im showing my friends and fans updates on my life but im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look  im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while im having my coffee at nine in the morning i think its healthy for your selfesteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once  lesson   being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snakeonly bite if someone steps on you  lesson   trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching thats good well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now thats not what i said or do it whatever maybe youll learn from it then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again but its fine do you youre searching  lesson 4  i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day  lesson 5  banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isnt cruel its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it  lesson 6  ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an impossible standard to meet and ive been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men  lesson 7  my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didnt know how we were going to keep  million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address ive ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love ive witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears  lesson 8  i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isnt real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want  lesson 9  i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimms cups aperol spritzes oldfashioneds and mojitos because06  lesson 0  ive always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know ill be making at dinner parties for life ina gartens real meatballs and spaghetti i just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat nigella lawsons mughlai chicken and jamie olivers chicken fajitas with molé sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head which is what im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex  lesson   recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if id hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape  lesson   apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional its so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say im sorry but and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships  lesson   its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying this happened to me its something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont  lesson 4  when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before its okay to say that you dont know what to say sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you dont have all the answers however its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point even if you cant really help the situation its nice for them to know that you would if you could  lesson 5  vitamins make me feel so much better i take ltheanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy  lesson 6  before you jump in headfirst maybe i dont knowget to know someone all that glitters isnt gold and first impressions actually arent everything its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them i call it a solid first 5 but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest selfaware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after theyve seen you broken or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people these are things a first impression could never convey  lesson 7  after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner do not do it i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why cant i be soft during all the seasons  lesson 8  realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone its important to address our longstanding issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them  lesson 9  playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess  lesson 0  learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about were in our young twenties hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever its sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but youll always keep the memories  lesson   fashion is all about playful experimentation if you dont look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe youre doing it wrong see bleachella  lesson   how to fight fair with the ones you love chances are youre not trying to hurt the person you love and they arent trying to hurt you if you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from theres a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight i know a couple who in the thick of a fight say hey same team find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built they dont give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship they just give out divorce papers  lesson   i learned that i have friends and fans in my life who dont care if im canceled they were there in the worst times and theyre here now the fans and their care for me my wellbeing and my music were the ones who pulled me through the most emotional part of the reputation stadium tour for me was knowing i was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up ill never forget the ones who stuck around  lesson 4  ive had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family both of my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again its taught me that there are real problems and then theres everything else my moms cancer is a real problem i used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs i give all of my worry stress and prayers to real problems now  lesson 5  i remember people asking me what are you gonna write about if you ever get happy theres a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art that art and suffering go hand in hand im really grateful to have learned this isnt true finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool  lesson 6  i make countdowns for things im excited about when ive gone through dark low times ive always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app theyre free and adding things im looking forward to even if theyre not big holidays or anything its good to look toward the future sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now and its good to get some perspective that life will always go on to better things  lesson 7  i learned that disarming someones petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh in my experience ive come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously a few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet the fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than ive ever felt in my life but i cant tell you how hard i had to keep from laughing every time my 6foot inflatable cobra named karyn appeared onstage in front of 60000 screaming fans its the stadium tour equivalent of responding to a trolls hateful instagram comment with lol it would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us but maybe all ill ever get is the satisfaction of knowing i could survive it and thrive in spite of it  lesson 8  im finding my voice in terms of politics i took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our daytoday life i saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk and felt like i had to speak up to try and help make a change only as someone approaching 0 did i feel informed enough to speak about it to my 4 million followers invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what i want from our leaders and i realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric im going to do more to help we have a big race coming up next year  lesson 9  i learned that your hair can completely change texture from birth i had the curliest hair and now it is straight its the straight hair i wished for every day in junior high but just as i was coming to terms with loving my curls theyve left me please pray for their safe return  lesson 0  my mom always tells me that when i was a little kid she never had to punish me for misbehaving because i would punish myself even worse id lock myself in my room and couldnt forgive myself as a fiveyearold i realized that i do the same thing now when i feel ive made a mistake whether its selfimposed exile or silencing myself and isolating ive come to a realization that i need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice trusting the wrong person or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone step into the daylight and let it go,pop

265,where will the music industry be in 0 years 0 years 50 years  before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingit's just coming alive  there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently  in recent years you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it  music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it's my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is i hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  arrows through the heart  in mentioning album sales i'd like to point out that people are still buying albums but now they're buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone it isn't as easy today as it was 0 years ago to have a multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us  there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans  in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be  there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie it's part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram  fan power  a friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to 005 when i walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around  another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me that's incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool  this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  celebrity spotlight  i predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s '80s and '90s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect i'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to  and as for me i'll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  and i'd also like a nice garden,pop
266,my momma stood across the room face to face but never eye to eye recalling words we said the battle that we swore we'd never fight breaking pieces off with every lie a tear came to her eye and she said   don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you block me out tonight honey where are you and don't hate me for loving you   he walked around my life and made blind with every single move he caught me staring at him mad about him little that i knew love is different when you play the fool and all i want to do is say   don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you make cry tonight like you always do and don't hate me for loving you   i slammed the door sat on the floor cried into my bed said are you there do you even care to cross above my head but someone said   don't turn away now and don't rip my heart out things are meant to happen like this i know it's right for you and don't hate me for loving you   i looked up at the sky face to face and finally eye to eye,pop

341,spoken writing the song lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter um i wrote it really quick in the middle of the night as soon as i wrote it i knew i wanted it to be the album title and i knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record so it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into and i wrote it alone so i wanted to go in and play it for jack antonoff who i knew who would be the perfect person to produce it and so i walked into the studio and i sat in the piano and this is what happened  so it is it's basically i don't see it as a piano i think it's that like kinda of dreamy y throwback but not like camp throwback so   sung we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january this is our place we make the rules and there's a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear have i known you 0 seconds or 0 years  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken yeah i love the walk down i love the walk down i was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there so the so  sung my my my my lover  we could let our friends crash on the couches this is our place we make the call and i'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you i've loved you three summers now honey but i want 'em all  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out and take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken okay and then i have this  thing that's um essentially well no i was i did i did it in this key but it could be this thing like a key change  so it plays off of the walk downish but it's this is the melody of it it goes it's like  sung ladies and gentlemen will you please stand with every  string scar on my hands i take this magnetic force oh fuck i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  spoken wait so goes like  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken so goes and you it goes  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me my heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken you like yeah i've never i never do these cords but i was really at the piano like hashing it out yesterday,pop

heard this song yet  tim mcgraw i have heard this song  radio dj tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time  tim mcgraw it was awesome uh except for i didn't know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old  radio dj ah ha ha ha  tim mcgraw i didn't know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i don't know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that i'm old i don't know if that's true but that's what i choose to think  radio dj why don't we find out taylor is a compliment or uh he's old  taylor swift oh its definitely a compliment yeah laughing  radio dj tim mcgraw meet taylor swift  tim mcgraw nice  taylor swift nice to meet you  tim mcgraw nice to meet you taylor how

uh having good music and everything i swear i'm not a stalker laughing  radio dj well  taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally 5 minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you haven't met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no we've never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i don't remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i don't know if she got it or not  taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me  tim mcgraw they didn't okay well there ya go i did laughing  radio dj so ii  taylor swift we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything  tim mcgraw not at all  radio dj so i thought i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind  taylor swift it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said tell me  taylor swift could you tell faith that i said hello  tim mcgraw i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way  taylor swift oh my gosh she's awesome  tim mcgraw i agree  radio dj this thistell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen  taylor swift well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school  tim mcgraw now i feel old  taylor swift and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well that's your first single laughing  taylor swift and i'm like well  tim mcgraw well you can write

383,my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character's does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  i'm highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i'm clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey's anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i'm convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs   i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i'm writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you'd think that as pop writers we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009  in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book,pop

399,my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in everyone looked worse in the light there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night but now i see daylight i only see daylight   luck of the draw only draws the unlucky so i became the butt of the joke i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked clearing the air i breathed in the smoke maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now it's brighter now now   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things i'm never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now i'm wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   and i can still see it all in my mind all of you all of me intertwined i once believed love would be black and white but it's golden golden and i can still see it all in my head back and forth from new york sneaking in your bed i once believed love would be burning red but it's golden like daylight like daylight like daylight like daylight   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things i'm never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now i'm wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   you gotta step into the daylight and let it go just let it go let it go,pop

401,i used to rule the world seas would rise when i gave the word now in the morning i sleep alone sweep the streets i used to own  i used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead long live the king  one minute i held the keys next the doors were closed on me and i discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt pillars of sand  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain once you go there was never never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what i'd become  revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever wanna be king  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world,pop

405,jameela jamil presents swift with her award  absolutely love this one right this is sort of a it's not a short speech so just i don't want this to slip and break 'cause it's very important to me  jamil takes the award from swift to hold  thank you so much she's so supportive we all need someone like that i'm taylor good evening i wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for   microphone stand lowers  whoa this is going great so far excellent okay i wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means i've seen a lot when this decade began i was 0 years old and i had put out my selftitled debut album when i was 6 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and i saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that i was really curious about i saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time  and i saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label it wasn't i saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and i saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when i became a mirror for my detractors whatever they decided i couldn't do is exactly what i did  audience claps  huh i'll take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples i can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me i usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and i did become the youngest  artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in 00 that i'd never experienced before as a young new artist all of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was i a little bit pitchy all of a sudden they weren't sure if i was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past i had had cowriters in the room  at that time i couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard i believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now i realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level i now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but i didn't know that then  so then i decided that i would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that i would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show i decided i would be what they said i couldn't be i didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else i wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and i would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics  they're saying i'm dating too much in my twenties okay i'll stop i'll just be single for years now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay i'll make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 989  audience cheers  oh you heard it sick now it's that i'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay i can stop doing that too now i'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman okay i'll disappear from public view for years now i'm being cast as a villain to you okay here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere  in the last ten years i have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist i really like his songs but i don't know what it is there's just something about him i don't like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know i've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art i've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized   someone in the audience cheers  yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes i like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us  and i see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work i absolutely love i see it in lizzo rosalía tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky g dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now  female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at a higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room  audience cheers  we now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade and that is the streaming world in music we're always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday i've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes i still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up and i hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators don't you  audience claps  lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that i feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person i feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if it's an app or a shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after i was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter braun's ithaca holdings in a deal that i'm told was funded by the soros family  capital and the carlyle group  yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how i might feel about the new owner of my art the music i wrote the videos i created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  i'm fairly certain he knew how i would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he's always been nice to me when i'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course he's nice to you if you're in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but i'm obviously not going willingly  yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and i will never ever forget it like ever  audience laughs  but to conclude i will say that in ten years i've seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct i've seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and i've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before i've leaned on that support and it has kept me in a place where no matter what i always wanted to keep making music for them  i was up on a stage in new york city in 04 accepting billboard woman of the year and i was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that  audience cheers  this speech i'm referring to was on my 5th birthday i'm about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was i really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in a piano lesson or in a girls' choir and today right now we need to take care of her i've since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in a girls' choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie  audience cheers  and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music  and as for me lately i've been focusing less on doing what they say i can't do and more on doing whatever the hell i want thank you for a magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade i'm honored to be here tonight i feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much,pop

438,i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor,pop

441,im writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on november 6th in which ill be voting in the state of tennessee in the past ive been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years i feel very differently about that now i always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights i believe we all deserve in this country i believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong i believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent  i cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is a woman named marsha blackburn as much as i have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office i cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values i will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 00 on every issue but we have to vote anyway  so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned 8 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october 9th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting,pop

469,i'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on november 6th in which i'll be voting in the state of tennessee in the past i've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years i feel very differently about that now i always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights i believe we all deserve in this country i believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong i believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent i cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is a woman named marsha blackburn as much as i have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office i cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values i will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 00 on every issue but we have to vote anyway so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned 8 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october 9th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting,pop

472,i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is 98 the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in 944 near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in 98 it's almost like she's golden,pop

475,to put it plainly we just couldnt stop writing songs to try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music we chose to wander deeper in ive never done this before in the past ive always treated albums as oneoff eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released there was something different with folklore in making it i felt less like i was departing and more like i was returning i loved the escapism i found in these imaginarynot imaginary tales i loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives so i just kept writing them,pop
