érdeklem őket doody az életem nagyrészében csak te voltál ott nekem pedig egyfolytában képeidet nézegetem sosem volt alkalmam hogy elmondjam neked hogy mennyire de nagyon szeretlek de viszont mondogatom ja amikor te már nem hallhatod viszont mi fasz jó abban hogy csinálom ezt valahogyan érzem jelenléted hogy itt vagy közel mellettem oh amúgy húsvétkor elmentem és vittem néhány ajándékot srácaidnak annak két gyönyörű fiúnak hogy legalább egy kicsit könnyítsek gondolataikon és tesó nem fogod elhinni de sharonda szóba áll velemjézusom mindenki próbálja darabjaiból összekaparni magát ember még hogy köthettél össze ennyi kibaszott sok életet és aztán csak így itt hagytál minket azt mondják hogy veszteség mindenkit máshogyan érint ha ez igaz akkor hogy faszba tehetném túl magamat rajtad ez valóban olyan nehéz amilyennek hangzik refrén obie trice doody egy könnycseppem foglalom rímekbe erre majd akkor fogsz rábukkanni amikor eljön az nap hogy nem fogom többé deshaun holtont hiányolni ez volt megírva ez volt elrendeltetve egy olyan harcos számára aki nagyon hamar eltávozik és itt hagyott üresen tátongva hogy vehetett el az isten egy ilyen jó lelket hátat fordítva és itt hagyva minket összetörött szívvel tudom hogy azt mondanád hogy lépj tovább légy férfi nincs érzelmeskedés ez kötelességed amíg nem találkozunk újra doody eminem doody így hívtuk mi egymást nem tudom már honnan jött ez de valahogy ránk ragadott mindig tesók voltunk sosem érdekelt minket egymás bőrszíne míg nem egy nap csak sétáltunk egy nyári napon lent téren lehetett vagy 90 fok én meg le égtem próbáltam fák alá húzódni hogy egy kis kényelembe helyezzem magamat csak nyafogok hogy végre érjek már haza aztán utánad nézek erre azt látom hogy te leveszed pólódat én meg erre megfogsz sülni te meg nem dehogy hisz én fekete vagyok hülye és feketék bőrébe melatonin vanmi nem égünk le közben az arcom izzad és úgy érzem hogy felgyulladok és te meg egész idő alatt röhögsz rajtam és meg csapkodsz pólóddal te szemét és ezt még mindig vissza akarom adni neked és amúgy meg azokat playboyos gyűrűket amiket anyám megfújt tőled végre nate megtalálta és vissza adta basszus kb 6 éve lehetett nos beteszem őket az ékszereid közé túlteszem magamat rajta de igazából még sem fogtam fel mindezt de arra mérget vehetsz hogy hagyatékod sosem fog feledésbe merülni motor city motown hip hop veterán hip

és ez lehet hogy egy kicsit furán hangzik de elmondom hogy megtaláltam az dzsekit amit az esküvőmön hagytál aztán felvettem és csak megszagoltam összehajtottam és egy üvegvitrinbe tettem aztán levittem folyosóra hogy bármikor rátudjak nézni és mi mindannyian én meg úgy érzünk hogy basszameg rap ez olyan számunkra mintha tábornokunk kibaszott karjaink közt halt volna meg kikapcsoltuk az össze személyhívónkat postafiókjaink száma mind megváltozott másik énjeinket szemétbe dobtuk tehát néhány macskának új utat kell majd találniuk és tudom hogy ez olyan mintha az álmok veled együtt meghalnának de az az igazság az hogy azok még mindig jelen vannak de te már nem vagy itt purple gang annyira beakartad őket futtatni ne adjátok fel az álmaitokat tesó én szeretlek titeket mindannyiótokat és doody az az igazság hogy összehoztad az embereket olyanokat akik amúgy sosem jöttek volna össze egy szobában ha nem miattad lett volna te voltál béketeremtő doody tudom hogy néha rosszkedvű voltál de utáltad konfrontációkat és igazából utáltad vitákat de kiálltál sajátjaidért még ha balhéra került sor ha valaminek megkellett történnie akkor annak meg kellett higgyél nekem tudom hogy te vagy az aki megtanított arra hogy hogy vágjak vissza még dresdenben amikor kocsikat festékpatronokkal lövöldöztük letartoztattak minket és egymással szembe ültünk cellában és csak röhögtünk azon hogy ezért 5 évre akartak minket rács mögé dugni de asszem azok ribancok meg faszok akikre rálőttünk még csak meg se jelentek bíróságon szóval technikailag szabadon elsétálhattunk én te
